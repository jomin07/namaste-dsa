// Insertion Sort
// Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
// It works by taking each element from the input and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
// Starting from the second element, it compares the current element with the previous ones, shifting larger elements one position ahead to make space for the current element.
// This process continues until all elements are sorted.
// Insertion Sort is efficient for small or nearly sorrted datasets and operates in-place without requiring extra memory.
// Approach:
// Start from the second element (index 1) since the first element is trivially “sorted”.
// Store the current element (curr) and compare it with all previous elements.
// Shift the previous elements one position forward if they are greater than the current element.
// Insert the current element (curr) at its correct sorted position.
// Repeat until the whole array is sorted.
// Time & Space Complexity:
// Time Complexity: O(n) Best Case Already Sorted.

// Average Case: O(n2)

// Worst Case: O(n2)Every element has to be compared and shifted back to the start.

// Space Complexity: O(1) No extra array is used; sorting is done in-place.
