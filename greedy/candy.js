// 135. Candy

// There are n children standing in a line.

// Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

// You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

// Each child must have at least one candy.
// Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
// Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

// Example 1:

// Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
// Example 2:

// Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
// The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

var candy = function (arr) {
  let n = arr.length;
  let lToR = Array(n).fill(1);
  let rToL = Array(n).fill(1);
  let res = 0;

  //filling left to right array
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {
      lToR[i] = lToR[i - 1] + 1;
    }
  }

  //filling right to left array
  for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
      rToL[i] = rToL[i + 1] + 1;
    }
  }

  //finding sum with max of both arrays
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    res += Math.max(lToR[i], rToL[i]);
  }

  return res;
};

// Approach:
// Left-to-right pass → If a child has a higher rating than the left neighbor, give them more candies than the neighbor.
// Right-to-left pass → If a child has a higher rating than the right neighbor, give them more candies than the neighbor.
// Final answer → For each child, take the maximum candies required from both passes and sum them up.
// Time & Space Complexity:
// Time Complexity: O(n)

// Space Complexity: O(n)
