Greedy Algorithm
Greedy is a problem solving approach where we make locally optimal choices, with a hope that it will lead to global optimal solution.
Take best choice at the moment, without worrying about the future.

Examples
Example 1: Coin Change Problem
Given an amount of n rupees and an unlimited supply of coins or notes of denominations {1, 2, 5, 10}. we have to find the minimum number of coins required to make up the 18 amount.
Intuition:
Firstly, choose the maximum denomination coin. Suppose we choose 10, now 8 is remaining.
If we choose the maximum coin (10) again, it exceeds the target, so we choose the second largest denomination, which is 5.
Now, 3 amount is left, so we choose 2.
Finally, we choose 1. Now our target is complete.
Example 2: Knap Sack Problem: Fractional Knap Sack Problem
Given n items where each item has some weight and profit associated with it and also given a bag with capacity W, [i.e., the bag can hold at most W weight in it]. The task is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of profits associated with them is the maximum possible.
Value = {60, 100, 120}, Weight = {10, 20, 30}, Weight only carry = 50kg
Intuition:
Since the bag has limited capacity, we cannot take all items, so we must choose them wisely.
Instead of directly picking the highest value items, we should compare items based on their value-to-weight ratio (value per unit weight).
This way, we prioritize items that give the maximum profit for the minimum weight.
By filling the bag with items having the highest value/weight ratio first, we maximize the total profit within the capacity constraint.
