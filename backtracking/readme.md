Backtracking
Recursive Algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them (backtracking) is they fail to satisfy constraints.

Note:
Exploring all possibility but being smart by abandoning wrong path early.

Example: Like trying all the paths in max and going back if you hit a wall.

When to use Backtracking ?
You want to explore all combination/permutations/subsets.
When there is a Clear way to validate a partial solution.
Number of combinations is too large to brute force, so you abandon the invalid ones early.
Basically, Backtracking optimise Recursion.

Note: Try a choice -> work ?, continue -> if not, undo (backtrack).

Example:
From the numbers [2, 3, 5, 10, 12], try to find a combination that gives a sum of 15. Solution.

- Label the numbers as x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄.
- Find all possible combinations.
- Think carefully about the choices.
- Develop the state space tree (or recursion tree, or path inside recursion) to find the solution.
- Initialize Sum = 0.
  Now, we have to make a decision: whether we want to include 2 or not.

Above, This is a type of problem that uses backtracking.

Choices: 25

Tree have maximum choices: 2n.

Use Cases:
Subset
Combinations
Permutations
N-Queens
A lot of choices and decisions
