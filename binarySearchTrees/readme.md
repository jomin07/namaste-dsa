Binary Search Tree Introduction
Binary Search Tree:
BST is a special type of Binary Tree with atmost 2 childern.
For Every Node:
All nodes of left subtree have smaller value.
All node of right subtree have greater value.

Important Point to Note:

All the subtrees of a tree should be BST.
A tree is a Binary Search Tree only if every node follows the BST rules.
Valid BST

Why it is called a Search Tree ?

Search the value 75:
Here, we are finding it in a very easy way — we don’t need to check unnecessary nodes.
At every iteration, the search space is reduced by half (n/2).
This makes searching very efficient, which is why it is called a Binary Search Tree.
Time Complexity: O(log n) As log n is the height of the tree.
Let’s try Inorder Traversal (left-node-right) of the tree:
10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85

Note: Inorder-traversal of BST is always sorted.
