// 1046. Last Stone Weight

// You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

// We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

// If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
// If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
// At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

// Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

// Example 1:

// Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
// we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
// we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
// we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
// Example 2:

// Input: stones = [1]
// Output: 1

var lastStoneWeight = function (stones) {
  let pq = new MaxPriorityQueue();
  for (let i = 0; i < stones.length; i++) {
    pq.enqueue(stones[i]);
  }

  while (pq.size() > 1) {
    let b = pq.dequeue();
    let a = pq.dequeue();

    if (b - a > 0) pq.enqueue(b - a);
  }

  return pq.dequeue() || 0;
};

// Approach
// Put all stones in a max-heap so the heaviest stones are always on top.
// While more than one stone remains:
// Remove the two heaviest stones (y and x).
// If they are not equal, insert the difference (y - x) back into the heap.
// Return the weight of the last stone, or 0 if none remain.
// Time Complexity:
// Time Complexity = O(n * m)

// Space Complexity:
// Space Complexity = O(1)
