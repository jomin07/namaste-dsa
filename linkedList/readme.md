Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure in which elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers. Each node contains:

A value (the actual data)
A reference (or pointer) to the next node (and optionally to the previous node in doubly linked lists)

Types of Linked Lists:

1. Singly Linked List
   value: the data part
   next: a pointer/reference to the next node
   It moves only in one direction (forward)
   Structure: [value | next] -> [value | next] -> [value | null]
2. Doubly Linked List
   value: the data
   next: pointer to the next node
   prev: pointer to the previous node
   Allows bidirectional traversal
   Structure: null <- [prev | value | next] <-> [prev | value | next] -> null
   Key Terminologies:
   Head: The first node of a linked list. It marks the entry point and points to the next node.
   Tail: The last node of a linked list. It points to null because there’s no node after it.
   Linked List Representation: It is typically represented using its head node.
